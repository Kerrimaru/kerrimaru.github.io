      <p>
        I'm Kerri, and I have recently entered the world of coding! I took the
        plunge, and attended an intensive four month web development programme
        at
        <a href="https://www.wegotcoders.com">We Got Coders.</a> Through morning
        lectures, afternoon pair programming, and evening self study I have
        developed a solid understanding of Ruby and developed a strong interest
        in database structures and Javascript. I've completed the training
        phase, and am now excited to continue my path as a web developer by
        getting my foot in the door at a great company and putting my skills to
        work in the real world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having formerly trained as a cabinetmaker I worked to create precise,
        functional furniture. I developed an eye for design, and could fuss over
        even the smallest details of a project. Some might say I'm a bit
        particular, but I like to think that these skills will serve me well as
        I transition into my new career as a web developer.
